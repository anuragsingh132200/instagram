**## Instagram Clone with Node.js, EJS, Express, BCrypt, and Passport Local**

This project is an implementation of an Instagram-like social media platform utilizing the following technologies:

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
* **Express.js:** Web framework built on Node.js for creating web applications.
* **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content.
* **bcrypt:** Cryptographic library for secure password hashing and salting.
* **Passport.js:** Middleware for authentication strategies, including local authentication in this project.

**Installation:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. **Clone the repository:** If applicable, clone this repository using Git.
3. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Running the application:**

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx nodemon
   ```
2. The application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your code) by default. You can access it in your web browser.

**Features:**

- **User registration and login:** Users can create accounts and log in using Passport local authentication with BCrypt salting and hashing for secure password storage.
- **Posts and feeds:** Users can create and view posts, including images and captions. A basic feed displays posts from followed users.
- **Following and followers:** Users can follow other users and see their posts in their feed.
- **Likes to posts:** Users can like other's posts and see their posts' likes in their feed.
**Further Development:**

This is a basic foundation for your Instagram clone. You can enhance it by adding features such as:

- **Image uploading and storage:** Implement logic to allow users to upload images and store them securely (e.g., using a cloud storage service).
- **Likes and comments:** Allow users to like and comment on posts, enabling interaction and engagement.
- **Search functionality:** Users can search for other users and posts by username or relevant keywords.
- **Direct messaging:** Facilitate private communication between users through a direct messaging system.
- **Profile management:** Users can personalize their profiles with profile pictures, biographies, and other information.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Sanitize user input:** Always sanitize user input to prevent potential vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Validate data types and lengths before using them in database queries or other sensitive operations.
- **Secure session management:** Implement session management practices that follow industry standards, such as using secure tokens and HTTPS for communication.
- **Regularly update dependencies:** Keep all dependencies updated to address known security vulnerabilities.

**Testing:**

- **Write unit and integration tests:** Ensure code functionality and catch potential regressions during development. Consider using testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for educational purposes only and does not aim to replicate the full functionality and security features of a production-grade social media platform. Be mindful of the security considerations highlighted above and conduct thorough security testing before deploying this application in a real-world environment.
